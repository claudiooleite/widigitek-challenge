# Restaurant Finder Challenge

## Overview
This project is a **Restaurant Finder Web Application** that allows users to explore various restaurants, view details, and mark their favorite spots. The application is built using **React, Redux, and Axios**, with **React Router** for navigation and **Redux Toolkit** for state management. It also includes an infinite scroll feature for seamless browsing.

## Features
- **Restaurant Listing Page**
  - Displays a paginated list of restaurants retrieved from an API.
  - Infinite scrolling to load more restaurants dynamically.
  - Users can mark/unmark restaurants as favorites.
  - A toggle button to filter and view only favorite restaurants.
  
- **Restaurant Details Page**
  - Displays restaurant-specific details such as name, address, contact information, and cuisines.
  - Includes a favorite button to add/remove restaurants from favorites.
  
- **State Management with Redux Toolkit**
  - The list of favorite restaurants is stored in Redux state.
  - The UI updates dynamically when the state changes.
  
- **Testing with Vitest & React Testing Library**
  - Unit tests ensure core functionality, such as UI rendering and state updates.
  - API requests are mocked for controlled testing.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, React Router
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
- **API Handling:** Axios
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Testing:** Vitest, React Testing Library

## API Integration
The project fetches restaurant data from:
```
https://api.wefood.dev/restaurants
```
- **GET /restaurants?offset={offset}&limit={limit}** â†’ Fetches a list of restaurants.
- **GET /restaurants/{id}** â†’ Fetches restaurant details by ID.

## Testing Strategy
- **Mocked API Requests:** Prevents dependency on live API responses.
- **State & UI Tests:** Ensures Redux state updates correctly and UI renders as expected.
- **Event Handling Tests:** Verifies user interactions such as clicking the favorite button.

## Future Improvements
- Implement search functionality for restaurants.
- Add user authentication and profiles.
- Improve UI with enhanced animations and transitions.
